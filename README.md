# Security rules for files access restriction in prestashop using nginx

After a recent migration of website build with Prestashop from apache2 to nginx i'll seen they have missing rules in the documentation of prestashop website.

The official documentation missed to add rules to restrict the access to sensitive directory.

The official documentation : http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/System+Administrator+Guide

To use you does to put my rules before the official rules for more effiency.
