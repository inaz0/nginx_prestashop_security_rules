# Security rules for files access restriction in prestashop using nginx

After a recent migration of website build with Prestashop from apache2 to nginx i'll seen they have missing rules in the documentation of prestashop website.

The official documentation : http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/System+Administrator+Guide

To use you does to put my rules before the official rules for more effiency.
